select 
d.dept_name,

dm.to_date,
e.calendar_year,
case
 when year (dm.to_date) >=e.calendar_year and 
 year(dm.from_date) <=e.calendar_year then 1 
 else 0
end as active 
from (select 
year(hire_date) as calendar_year 
from t_employees 
group by calendar_year) e cross join 
t_dept_manager dm
join t_departments d on dm.dept_no= d.dept_no
join t_employees ee on dm.emp_no=ee.emp_no
order by dm.emp_no, calendar_year;

task 3
Compare the average salary of female versus male employees in the entire company until yr 2002, and add a filter allowing to see that per each department.

select
e.gender,
d.dept_name, 
round(avg(s.salary),2) as salary,

from 
t_salaries s

delimiter $$
create procedure filter_salary (in p_min_salary float,
in p_max_salary float) 
begin 
select 
e.gender,
d.dept_name, 
avg(s.salary) as avg_salary 
from t_salaries s 
join t_employees e on s.emp_no=e.emp_no

join t_departments d on d.dept_no=de.dept_no
where s.salary between p_min_salary and p_max_salary 
group by d.dept_no, e.gender;
end $$
delimiter ;
call filter_salary(50000,90000);
